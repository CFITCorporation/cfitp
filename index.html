		"I won't take advantage of you.",
		"Not even while you are looking at code.",

		"I would never do such a thing.",
		"Cross my heart and hope to die.",

		"I should really just make the jump scare.",
		"Maybe make it a micro-transaction game.",
		"Wait a day or pay $5 for the next potential jump scare.",
		"Not potential as in waiting to be expressed into reality.",
		"Just potential in an agnostic sense.",
		"I can't say it couldn't happen.",
		"Maybe a severe glitch 'just happens'.",
		"Maybe something that you can't forget, no matter how much you want to.",
		"Scares you real bad.",
		"One of those jump scares that makes your heart beat faster.",
		"For way too long.",
		"And where you feel jumpy all day.",
		"One of those.",
		" ",
